## **hyperiondev software engineering bootcamp - Level 3, Task 12: Semantic Similarity (NLP)**

### _**Project Description**_
This project consists of a very simple python program that contains the example code given to us by Hyperiondev to help explain how spaCy, a python NLP library, detects similarity within texts. I was told to run the program and observe the difference in similarity between three different words given by the program, using the 'en_core_web_md' model. We were also given an example.py file (not included in this repo) that had code that determined the similarity between sentences, using the 'en_core_web_md' model and then switching the 'en_core_web_md' with the lower level 'en_core_web_sm' model, and observing the differences between the accuracy of the program's analysis of the similarity between the different sentences given. I then had to write down my observations within this project, using comments and docstrings. 

### _**Installation**_
In order to install this project, you will need the following:
* internet connection
* python
* a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code
* Docker Desktop - if you wish to deploy this project using Docker (a Dockerfile has been included in this repo)


### _**Usage**_
In order to run this program you need to install spaCy, which you can do by entering the following in your command prompt/terminal:
**pip install spacy** or **pip3 install spacy**
You can then down load the different language models used in this project, by entering:
**python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm** or **python -m spacy download en_core_web_md**
